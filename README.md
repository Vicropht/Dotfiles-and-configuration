My dotfiles for WSL together with Cmder or Hyper 

### Usage
Just run `install.sh` to install zsh + oh-my-zsh and symlink all dotfiles.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Vicropht/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ sudo ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

To use my settings, just copy the Hyper.js file to your Windows home directory or import the cmder settings

```
cp .hyper.js /mnt/c/Users/{YOUR_USER}/
```
### Windows Terminal
I am using Windows Terminal now. Haven't changed the script for it though, for now I'll just [link this post](https://medium.com/@hjgraca/style-your-windows-terminal-and-wsl2-like-a-pro-9a2e1ad4c9d0) that got me thought it.
